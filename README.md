# Ralph's Shell Scripts

These are a series of utility scripts for Bash, based on originals from Matthew McCullough (via Jim Lawton), with some additions of mine.

As Matthew said in his original:
"Many are derived from prior works of open source, but some original URLs have been lost. Please point out any original art URLs and they will be added. I always strive to give credit to prior art authors."

Please fork, fix, enhance, and send pull requests.
